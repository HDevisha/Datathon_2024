1. Library Importation

    Imports necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and various Scikit-learn tools for preprocessing, model selection, ensemble methods, and metrics.

2. Data Loading and Preparation

    Loads a dataset named "FeatureSelection.csv" into a DataFrame.
    Defines a target variable, presumably from the dataset, named "potential_total_value_of_award".
    Prepares feature variables by dropping the target variable and any rows with missing values.
    Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame for a quick overview.

3. Feature Analysis

    Identifies binary, low-cardinality, and high-cardinality features based on the number of unique values in each feature column.
    Preprocesses features through one-hot encoding for categorical variables and standard scaling for numerical variables.

4. Model Training and Evaluation

    Splits the data into training and testing sets.
    Trains and evaluates multiple regression models, including RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor.
    Evaluates model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. Feature Importance Analysis

    Analyzes feature importance to identify which features significantly impact the model's predictions.
    Based on the importance analysis, non-essential features are eliminated, and the model is retrained with a reduced set of features to potentially improve performance.

6. Reduced Model Training and Evaluation

    Repeats the model training and evaluation process with the reduced feature set for both RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor models.
    Compares the performance of models trained with the reduced feature set against those trained with the original set of features, using R-squared and RMSE as metrics.
